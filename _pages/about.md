# üíª Projects
- [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning) (300+ stars and 20+ forks!) is a Pytorch-based Python package for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). It is easy-to-use/extend, affordable, and comprehensive for developing and evaluating SSL algorithms. USB provides the implementation of 14 SSL algorithms based on Consistency Regularization, and 15 tasks for evaluation from CV, NLP, and Audio domain. I am the main contributor to this repo and now leading the USB team.
- [TorchSSL](https://github.com/TorchSSL/TorchSSL) (950+ stars and 150+ forks!) is an all-in-one toolkit based on PyTorch for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Currently, we implemented 9 popular SSL algorithms to enable fair comparison and boost the development of SSL algorithms. I am the main contributor to this repo and now leading the TorchSSL team.
- [Microsoft NeuralSpeech](https://github.com/microsoft/NeuralSpeech) (600+ stars and 75+ forks!) is a research project in Microsoft Research Asia focusing on neural network based speech processing, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), text to speech (TTS), etc. The code of Exploiting Adapters for Cross-lingual Low-resource Speech Recognition (TASLP 2022) has been moved to this repo.
